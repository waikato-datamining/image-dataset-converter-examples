The [image-dataset-converter](https://github.com/waikato-datamining/image-dataset-converter) 
library (and its dependent libraries) can be used for converting **image datasets** from one format 
into another. It has I/O support for the following domains:

* Image classification
* Object detection
* Image segmentation

Please refer to the [dataset formats](https://github.com/waikato-datamining/image-dataset-converter?tab=readme-ov-file#dataset-formats)
section for more details on supported formats.

But the library does not just convert datasets, you can also slot in complex filter pipelines to 
process/clean the data.

On this website you can find examples for:

* [Image classification](image_classification.md)
* [Object detection](object_detection.md)
* [Image segmentation](image_segmentation.md)
* [Filter usage](filters.md)
* [Docker usage](docker.md)

Examples for the additional libraries:

* [Image augmentation](imgaug.md)
* [Image statistics](imgstats.md)
* [Image visualizations](imgvis.md)
* [PDF](pdf.md)
* [Redis](redis.md)
* [Video](video.md)
